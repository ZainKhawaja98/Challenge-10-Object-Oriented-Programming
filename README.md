# challenge-10-object-oriented-programming

## Description
I wanted to build a node.js command line application that takes in the input and creates an HTML file. I had to test the code to ensure it passes which took many tries. It solves the problem of having to make the entire code from scatch and instead uses the template which needs to be filled in and generates the finished code.
